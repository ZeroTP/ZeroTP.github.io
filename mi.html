                        <p><strong>What is the zero tolerance policy?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
	                        <li>The purpose is to control student behavior</li>
	                        <li>Regardless of how minor the behavior is of the student, they will receive the same consequence as if it were major</li>
	                        <li>This policy uses one-size-fits-all and one-strike-youâ€™re-out rules</li>
	                        <li>Applies to drugs, violence, weapons, hate speech bullying and dress codes</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Why is the zero tolerance policy used in schools?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
	                        <li>In the 1980s it was used to prevent the use of drugs</li>
	                        <li>There was  a massacre in Colorado at Columbine High School in 1999</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Why is the zero tolerance policy flawed?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
	                        <li>There is little to no evidence that shows zero tolerance policies decrease violence</li>
	                        <li>This policy caused an increase in students getting suspended</li>
	                        <li>Critics say the zero tolerance should only be used in prison</li>
	                        <li>Just one suspension can cause a student to drop out later on</li>
	                        <li>It is often confusing what is considered against the rules because the policy is so broad</li>
	                        <li>Students get suspended for minor things like brining a plastic knife and having asprin in their backpack</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>What are some examples of the zero tolerance policy being used in school?</strong></p>
                        <ul>	
	                        <li>In Grand Rapids, Michigan, a kindergarten student pretended to shoot a friend during playtime with his fingers, and he received a two-day suspension.</li>
	                        <li>A high school student made a poem about a terrible shooting at an elementary school in a personal journal. The poem was about the shooter and a teacher found it and reported it. Instead of it being viewed as a creative piece of writing, it was viewed as a threat, and the student was suspended.</li>
	                        <li>A middle schooler in Seattle got expelled for bringing a water gun to school.</li>
	                        <li>Students were suspended for more than a week for being caught in the hallways when class had already started. Sending them home is not going to teach them to attend class again. If anything, it will cause them to continue skipping class so they do not have to attend school.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>What do defenders of the zero tolerance policy believe, and how can that be argued?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
	                        <li>Defenders say that it is to prevent discrimination against certain individuals, but statistics show that African American and Latino students are suspended more often. Certain students can be targeted for doing something very minor and become suspended.</li>
	                        <li>It is against the rules to possess even legal drugs if a parents signature and a document that the office has is not present. Defenders say that is fine, but it is taking away the right to privacy. A student once had birth control pills and got suspended because she did not have her parents consent. This rule is taking the right to privacy away because it is preventing female students from possessing birth control pills without their parents knowing. Some parents do not believe birth control methods should be used. Therefore, it is also preventing students from using safe methods of birth control.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>What are some alternatives to zero tolerance?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
	                        <li>Narrowing what it applies to: Legal drug possession should not have the same consequences as illegal drug possession</li>
	                        </li><a href="rj.html">Restorative Justice</a>: Both offender and victim receive the help/resources they need. Benefits to restorative justice include better attendance and test scores.</li>
                        </ul>
